This is a fairly simple script that should make it easy to get
selenium running as a headless daemon on debian-based servers.

It will install all the dependencies needed to run the selenium-rc
server, then, if necessary, will download selenium-rc and install
it under /opt.

It will then generate an init script (/etc/init.d/selenium) and
a default config file (/etc/default/selenium) that should be
sufficient to make it all work nicely.

This is definitely not the most secure or efficient means of setting
up selenium. There are parts of the init script that I know are
horribly ugly and hacky... however, it works well for me, and I am
hoping that people will send me lots of recommendations, bug reports
and patches!
